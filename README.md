Abstract Machines Certicate Manager is an open source, lightweight, scalable, and customizable certs manager. This PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) service provides a comprehensive set of features for managing digital certificates. It includes an SDK, CLI, and API that enable the following functionality:

- Certificate Issuance: Issue new certificates for entities, specifying parameters like the certificate type, TTL, IP addresses, and subject options.
- Certificate Renewal: Renew existing certificates in the database.
- Certificate Revocation: Revoke certificates that are no longer valid or trusted.
- Certificate Retrieval: Retrieve certificate records from the database, including options to view, download, and get OCSP responses.
- Certificate Listing: List certificates based on various filters, such as entity ID, expiry time, and revocation status.
- Certificate Authority (CA) Management: Retrieve the chain of CA certificates (root and intermediate) and generate Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

## Features

- PKI (Certicate renewal)
- Active revocation (CRL, OSCP)
- API (For management of PKI)
- SDK
- CLI

## Prerequisites

The following are needed to run absmach certs:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (version 26.0.0)

Developing absmach certs will also require:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.21)
- [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation) (version 25.1)

## Install

Once the prerequisites are installed, clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/absmach/certs.git
cd certs
```

Execute the following commands from the project's root:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file docker/.env -p absmach up
```

This will bring up the certs docker services and interconnect them. This command can also be executed using the project's included Makefile:

```bash
make run
```

## Usage

### SDK

 Absmach certs provides an SDK that can be imported and used in your Go applications. Here's an example of how to use the SDK:

 ```go
 cert , _ := sdk.IssueCert("entityID", "10h", []string{"ipAddr1", "ipAddr2"}, sdk.Options{CommonName: "commonName"})
fmt.Println(cert)
 ```

### CLI

Absmach certs also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the service. The CLI supports the following commands:

- `issue`: Issue a new certificate
- `get`: List certificates
- `token`: Gets download token
- `download`: Downloads a certificate
- `renew`: Renew an existing certificate
- `revoke`: Revoke a certificate
- `view`: Retrieve a certificate
- `generate-crl`: Generate a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
- `token-ca`: Gets CA download token
- `download-ca`: Retrieve the chain of CA certificates

### API

The absmach certs exposes a RESTful API that can be used to interact with the service programmatically. Here is an example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ip_addresses":["191.168.101.16"],"ttl":"10h","options":{"organization":["organization_name"]}}' \
  http://localhost:9010/certs/issue/64eeb24e-6154-48c4-ad32-e4fb02ed32da\?common_name\=thing
```
